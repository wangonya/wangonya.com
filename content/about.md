# Kelvin Wangonya
## Software Engineer

I'm currently working at [Jenga][jenga] as a backend developer for [Artefact][artefact] - a global data & AI consulting company.

My current day-to-day at work involves:
 - maintaining and refactoring a large legacy Flask project (Python)
 - building all the newer parts of the codebase in FastApi (MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, etc)
 - managing infrastructure on GCP (App Engine, CloudSql, Bigquery, etc)
 - some data engineering (Bigquery)
 - some frontend work (React, Typescript)

Sometimes I [write][blog] about stuff I've learned, personal projects, and anything else I find interesting.

Other times, I [read][reading]. I've read a lot of books but I've never been keen on keeping a record. I decided to start keeping this record on `2023-08-14`, so everything on that page is as from this date.

When I want to read something other than books, I like browsing the web - the old fashioned way. I keep a list of my favorite websites and articles [here][links].

The fastest way to reach me is through [email][email].
