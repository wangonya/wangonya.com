I'm currently working at [Jenga][jenga] as a backend developer for [Artefact][artefact] - a global data & AI consulting company.

My current day-to-day at work involves:

- maintaining and refactoring a large legacy Flask project (Python)
- building all the newer parts of the codebase in FastApi (MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, etc)
- managing infrastructure on GCP (App Engine, CloudSql, Bigquery, etc)
- some data engineering (Bigquery)
- some frontend work (React, Typescript)
