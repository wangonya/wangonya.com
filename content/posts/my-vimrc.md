title: "Creating my own vim config"

Since I started using Vim, I've always either used it as it comes with no custom configs or plugins (to edit simple text files), or using someone else's custom config (usually [this](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) or [specevim](https://spacevim.org/)). 

While these prebuilt configurations have worked fine for me so far, I always feel like I'm not taking full advantage of what they offer. This is mostly because they come with plugins that I never use - and keybindings that, either just don't feel right to me (like `SPC f s` to save on spacevim - I prefer `<leader>w`) or that I don't even know exist.

I think the only way to have Vim exactly the way you want it is to either spend the time to customise the prebuild configs to your liking - or create your own from scratch with only the plugins you know you'll use and with keybindings that feel just right to you. I've decided to create mine from scratch.
