I just came across <a href="https://magic.reactjs.net/htmltojsx.htm">this</a> online HTML to JSX Compiler. 
If you're new (or not) to react and you're still having a little trouble with JSX, I think this tool is great for learning. 

Just paste in your HTML in the HTML editor on the left, and it'll be converted into valid JSX on the right.
