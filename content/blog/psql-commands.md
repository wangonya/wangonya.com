Running `\?` within a psql database gives a whole list of
commands that come in handy when performing various kinds of tasks.

```shell
$ psql
psql (13.0)
Type "help" for help.

wangonya=# \?
General
  \copyright             show PostgreSQL usage and distribution terms
  \crosstabview [COLUMNS] execute query and display results in crosstab
  \errverbose            show most recent error message at maximum verbosity

  .....
```

But what are the queries executed when these commands run?

I was recently tasked to write a bash script that loops through every
schema on a database and does a `pg_dump` on it for backup
then uploads the backups to an external server.

Running `\dn` gives a list of schemas but it also gives the
owners, which I didn\'t need in my case.

```shell
wangonya=# \dn
  List of schemas
  Name  |  Owner
--------+----------
 public | wangonya
 x      | wangonya
 y      | wangonya
(3 rows)
```

I only needed the schema names so I had to look for a way to edit the
query run by `\dn` to only return names.

From the psql [docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-psql.html):

> `-E` \> `--echo-hidden`
>
> Echo the actual queries generated by `\d` and other
> backslash commands. You can use this to study psql\'s internal
> operations. This is equivalent to setting the variable ECHO_HIDDEN to
> on.

Running psql with the `-E` flag then running the
`/dn` command gives this result:

```shell
$ psql -E

wangonya-# \dn
********* QUERY **********
SELECT n.nspname AS "Name",
  pg_catalog.pg_get_userbyid(n.nspowner) AS "Owner"
FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace n
WHERE n.nspname !~ '^pg_' AND n.nspname <> 'information_schema'
ORDER BY 1;
**************************

  List of schemas
  Name  |  Owner
--------+----------
 public | wangonya
 x      | wangonya
 y      | wangonya
(3 rows)
```

With the underlying query executed on running the slash command, I was
able to edit it get the desired result.
