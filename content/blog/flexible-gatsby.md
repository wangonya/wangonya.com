## Quick Start ðŸš€

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

```sh
# create a new Gatsby site using the flexible-gatsby starter
gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/wangonya/flexible-gatsby
```

2.  **Start developing.**

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

```sh
cd my-blog/
gatsby develop
```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

Edit `gatsby.config.js` to update site metadata.

Add blog posts in markdown in `content/blog`. Example blog posts have been provided.
