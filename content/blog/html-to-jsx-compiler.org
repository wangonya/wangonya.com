I just came across [[https://magic.reactjs.net/htmltojsx.htm][this]] online HTML to JSX Compiler. If you're new (or
not) to react and you're still having a little trouble with JSX, I think
this tool is great for learning.

Just paste in your HTML in the HTML editor on the left, and it'll be
converted into valid JSX on the right.
