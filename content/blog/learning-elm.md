I avoid doing front-end work whenever I can. If I had my way, I'd never touch it. But I'm not in a position to always have my way _(yet)_ so every now and then, I find myself having to play around with a JS framework or two.

A few weeks ago, I discovered <a href="https://elm-lang.org/" target="_blank">Elm</a> and I must say, I've never had this much fun developing UIs.

The language has a bit of a learning curve. I'm still learning and I've not made anything useful with it so far but I plan to use it as my main front-end language for my side-projects moving forward.
