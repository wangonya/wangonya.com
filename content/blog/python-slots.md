I just learned about this today while going through the [python mastery][python mastery] course.
Apparently, some good memory optimization can be done by using it in classes.

[This answer][__slots__ explanation] does a good job explaining how it works.

I've not had a need for it yet, but it's a good thing to keep in mind for when I do end up needing it.
