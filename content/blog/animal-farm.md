## What is this book about?

Animal Farm is a novel by George Orwell first published in 1945. It's about animals in a farm who get tired of being mistreated by their human masters and decide to rebel - successfully ousting the humans and running the farms by themselves. Led by the smartest animals in the farm - the pigs - the animals set out to govern themselves and agree on seven commandments as laws. As many animals are not able to read and understand all those commandments, they are summarized into one easy one: "Four legs good. Two legs bad.". They all agree that all animals are equal.

All is well in the start until power corrupts the pigs and they start abusing their authority. The seven commandments are manipulated to fit their interests and revolters are executed. In the end, the pigs become just like the humans - even worse in some ways. They even end up walking on two legs. In the end, the one easy commandment becomes, "Four legs good, two legs BETTER.".

## Expectations

I had heard about this book ever since I was very young. I thought it was a children story book because I first heard of it in the Swahili translation _"Shamba la Wanyama"_. I expected a good story with a moral lesson at best.

## Experience
This book went way beyond my expectations. It gave me a whole new perspective on how the world works, expecially in regard to poilitics. While reading it, I could draw a lot of parallels with the current political situation in my country and in other places. The book is very well written.

## Lessons from the book

Here are a few lessons I took from the book:

- The phrase **"power corrupts"** may be cliche and not entirely true in all situations, but it's certainly the case more often than not.
