I just came across [this](https://magic.reactjs.net/htmltojsx.htm)
online HTML to JSX Compiler. If you\'re new (or not) to react and
you\'re still having a little trouble with JSX, I think this tool is
great for learning.

Just paste in your HTML in the HTML editor on the left, and it\'ll be
converted into valid JSX on the right.
