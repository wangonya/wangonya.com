i work remotely. slack has made it very easy to pull someone for a call. i find it distracting. 
i understand why people do this. i also do.

many benefits to writing things down. think better. refer back to knowledge.
realise didnt need the call after all.

very unlikely that i'll be completely blocked without immediate answer. and even then, calling someone isn't a guarantee that they'll be immediately available - then i still need to write it down anyway.

default to async.
